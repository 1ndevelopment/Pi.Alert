# Pi.Alert
<!--- --------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

WIFI / LAN intruder detector.

Scan the devices connected to your WIFI / LAN and alert you the connection of
unknown devices. It also warns if a "always connected" devices disconnects.

## How it works
The system continuously scans the network for:
  - New devices
  - New connections (re-connections)
  - Disconnections
  - "Always Connected" devices down
  - Devices IP changes
  - Internet IP address changes

## Scan Methods
Up to three scanning methods are used:
  - **Method 1: arp-scan**. The arp-scan system utility is used to search
        for devices on the network using arp frames.
  - **Method 2: Pi-hole**. This method is optional and complementary to
        method 1. If the Pi-hole DNS server is active, Pi.Alert examines its
        activity looking for active devices using DNS that have not been
        detected by method 1.
  - **Method 3. dnsmasq**. This method is optional and complementary to the
        previous methods. If the DHCP server dnsmasq is active, Pi.Alert
        examines the DHCP leases (addresses assigned) to find active devices
        that were not discovered by the other methods.

## Components
The system consists of two parts:

### Back
In charge of:
  - Scan the network searching connected devices using the scanning methods
    described
  - Store the information in the DB
  - Report the changes detected by e-mail and/or other services ([Apprise](https://hub.docker.com/r/caronc/apprise), [Pushsafer](https://www.pushsafer.com/), [NTFY](https://ntfy.sh/), Webhooks ([sample JSON](docs/webhook_json_sample.json)))
  - Optional speedtest for Device "Internet"
  - DB cleanup tasks via cron
  - a pialert-cli that helps to configure login and password  

  | ![Report 1][report1] | ![Report 2][report2] |
  | -------------------- | -------------------- |

### Front
There is a configurable login to prevent unauthorized use. 

> * Set `PIALERT_WEB_PROTECTION = True` in `pialert.conf` to enable. The default password is `123456`.
> To change password run `/home/pi/pialert/back/pialert-cli`

A web frontend that allows:
  - Manage the devices inventory and the characteristics
  - Display in a visual way all the information collected by the back
    - Sessions
    - Connected devices
    - Favorites
    - Events
    - Presence
    - Concurrent devices
    - Down alerts
    - IP's
    - Manual Nmap scans
    - Optional speedtest for Device "Internet"
    - Simple Network relationship display
  - Maintenance tasks and Settings like:
    - Status Infos (active scans, database size, backup counter)
    - Theme Selection (blue, red, green, yellow, black, purple)
    - Language Selection (english, german, spanish)
    - Light/Dark-Mode Switch
    - Pause arp-scan
    - DB maintenance tools
    - DB Backup and Restore
    - CSV Export / Import (Experimental)
  - Help/FAQ Section

# Installation
<!--- --------------------------------------------------------------------- --->
Initially designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, probably it can run on many other
Linux distributions.

> ‚ö† Please note, this [fork (jokob-sk)](https://github.com/jokob-sk/Pi.Alert) is only tested via the [docker install method](dockerfiles/README.md). Check out [leiweibau's fork](https://github.com/leiweibau/Pi.Alert/) if you want to isntall Pi.Alert on teh server directly.
